xsecurelock (1.5.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Upstream version 1.5.1
  * Bump Standards-Version from 4.1.4 to 4.3.0
  * Changes from upstream version 1.5.1
    * XSECURELOCK_FORCE_GRAB no longer sometimes fails to re-map the unmapped
      windows in case locking fails despite the forcing. Previously, a missing
      XSync call led to the re-mapping sometimes not taking effect.
  * Changes from upstream version 1.5.0
    * Always wake up from mouse motion events.
    * Set PAM_RHOST to "localhost" as recommended by the Linux-PAM manual; add
      a feature to disable setting this field entirely as a workaround for
      pam_fprintd.
    * Remove some stderr spam.
    * Detect VNC and Chrome Remote Desktop servers and refuse to lock them, as
      locking them would not make much sense (can be overridden).
    * Allow the helpers directory to be recreated while xsecurelock is
      running. Fixes issues like "cannot unlock after unattended package
      upgrade".
